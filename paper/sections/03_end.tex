\section{Discussion}
Our three-gate decision framework provides clear guidance: NTRU-Prime-hrss offers the best balance, ML-KEM-512 excels in handshake performance, while Classic-McEliece fails practical deployment requirements despite highest security.

\section{Conclusion}
Through 4,608 experimental runs, we demonstrate that transport effects dominate cryptographic costs in typical IoT deployments. Our safe-area scoring and loss elasticity metrics enable operators to make informed KEM selections for their specific network conditions.
