# Development Planning Notes

This document contains early planning notes from the project development phase.
The actual implementation may differ from initial plans as the codebase evolved.

## Original Planning Checklist

These were the initial goals during development. Most have been addressed in the current implementation.

### Completed
- ✅ Full KEM implementation with liboqs integration
- ✅ MQTT broker with PQC support
- ✅ Network simulation framework
- ✅ Hardware monitoring capabilities
- ✅ Statistical analysis suite
- ✅ Data generation pipeline

### Future Work
- Formal security proofs with ProVerif/Tamarin
- Real hardware deployment on ESP32/STM32
- Distributed broker testing
- Side-channel analysis
